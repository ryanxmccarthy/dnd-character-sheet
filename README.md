# DnD-Characters
This application allows users to create a dungeons and dragons character sheet that is stored online and accessible across numerous devices thanks to responsive CSS styling. 

We began by whiteboarding the entire process and using Trello to set deadlines for the specific functionality.

We then created all the files we would need for the MVC file structure. Our front end team began working on the HTML pages and custom CSS files. Our back end team initiated the server and began working on the API and HTML routes. 

Once everything was running, we created the database connection allowing the user to store and recall their characters. 

Finally, we deployed to heroku and fixed any bugs we experienced.
